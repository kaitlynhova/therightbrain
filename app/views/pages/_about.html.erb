      <h1>STILL KICKIN'</h1>
      <p>I was born with an absolute IgA deficiency, which is a fancy way of saying illness was the primary component of my childhood. If my mom wasn’t a nurse I wouldn’t be here today. I had Pneumonia 13 times, ear tubes, and multiple other ailments. I wasn’t supposed to live past 6 years old, but I can be very stubborn. Although I will never have any levels of Iga, I have built up an arsenal of every other immune globulin. I hardly ever get sick any more.</p>

      <h1>BEGINNING MUSIC</h1>
      <p>Age six was a huge milestone in my life, so my parents bought me my first piano and picked up violin at age 9. I don’t remember ever making the decision to play violin. Initially I was just in it for the ice cream I would receive at the end of Orchestra concerts. Kids.</p>

      <h1>GIGGING PROFESSIONALLY</h1>
      <p>I joined the ranks of my private lesson teachers in the Omaha Musicians Union and started gigging at the age of 14. My first professional gigs were with Mannheim Steamroller, Rod Stewart and Josh Groban. Gigs that followed included: Mary J Blige, Michale Bublé, Pam Tillis, Gladys Knight, The Canadian Tenors, Tim Kasher, and Trans Siberian Orchestra. Mannhiem Steamroller really took me under its wing, and I began observing what it takes to be a real musician.</p>

      <h1>BUSINESS OWNERSHIP</h1>
      <p>I was an apprentice at Midwest Violins and decided to open my own business to fix/make violins and book wedding gigs. The Musicians of Mannheim Steamroller had taught me that in order to be a musician, you had to be in “the business of yourself.” I took this advice literally and started my own business, Eloquent Acoustics, at age fourteen.</p>

      <h1>INTERNATIONAL BACCAULAUREATE DIPLOMA</h1>
      <p>Although I had been excelling at music, I also had a passion for more ‘left brain’ oriented studies, and a penchant for suffering that harkened back to childhood illnesses. I earned my High school International Baccalaureate degree in 2006 while also professionally gigging at night. I specialized in Spanish and Biology and Red Bull. Lots of Red Bull.</p>

      <h1>BERKLEE COLLEGE OF MUSIC</h1>
      <p>Berklee College of Music, majoring in Music Business and Rock Violin Performance, was an amazing experience. It was also at this time that I began work in film scoring. I joined the Boston Musician’s Union, which knew my story and kindly referred me to have an article in International Musician magazine that year.</p>

      <h1>NEUROSCIENCE DEGREE</h1>
      <p>Earned a Degree in Neuroscience from the University of Nebraska at Omaha. I pursued this degree once I found out that my ability to hear sounds as colors is, in fact, not normal but a phenomenon known as synesthesia. I had also been Concertmaster of the Intergenerational Orchestra of Omaha, which played in nursing homes. Observing the effects of neurodegenerative diseases in a primary audience was another driving factor in my decision to pursue neuroscience.</p>
